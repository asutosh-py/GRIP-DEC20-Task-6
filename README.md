# GRIP-DEC20-Task-6
This is the work I have done as a data science and business analytics intern in GRIP DEC 2020 by The Sparks Foundation.
Created a Decision Tree classifier and visualized it graphically. 
The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to 
predict the right class accordingly.
